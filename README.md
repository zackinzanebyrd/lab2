I designed this map for low income families in Vancouver to locate non-market government subsidized housing near their location. This map attempted to also incorporate a filter function as to locate and filter housing within specific neighbourhoods but I was unsuccessful in doing so. I also intended to do a comparison between income levels and the distribution of non-market housing but could not come up with a formula that would be able to rank the proportion of non-market housing to the number of residents that could make use of such services in the neighbourhoods. My process of the map initially incorporated a choropleth map within it as well that was to compare income levels with the number of non market housing units in the neighbourhood, but with Mapbox me and Vicky were only able to access the feature layer of info which was of my non-market housing layer. She also helped to assist with the interactive click function of the icons in which I then fleshed it out with details regarding the name of the housing, the location as well as the URL to access and possibly register to utilize the amenities. For my interactivity in the map, I made it such that you could locate your current location with a widget requesting your locational information. From there, a marker would be placed at your location so that you could visually see which non-market housing units were nearby. I originally wanted to use turf.js to analyze the closest nearby locations, but due to my data being called off the Mapbox style I had implemented in my map I could not find tutorials on how to call the data off the style. Moreover, the significant number of points made it such that manually inputting all the values into my code such that I could use turf.js made it infeasible given the timeframe of this assignment. However, I was still able to set it such that clicking on the non market housing icons would reveal the name of the housing unit, the address as well as the URL such that users may access the website to apply for housing. For my choice of data, the change of the audience from a research oriented map to a public use map reduced the amount of data I would implement onto it so that it would be less confusing to understand and read. I opted to include main road networks and amenities as to assist these low income residents to make choices on where they would opt to register for non-market housing. If I could improve my map, it would be to implement the filter function within it as to allow residents to search and find housing within the specific neighbourhoods they were wishing to find housing in. Another feature that I would've liked to implement is a toggle to sort by the number of bedrooms in these housing units as to allow residents to find units that would suit the needs of a young family vs the needs of a single elderly resident.
